# Design history for NHS.UK services

A place for you to document your NHS.UK service designs.

## Purpose of this project

This repository makes it easy to:

- screenshot your designs
- create pages of screenshots to document designs
- document designs using the [NHS.UK design system](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system)
- print pages of designs
- make designs shareable and linkable

## Installation and getting started

Read our guide on how to [set up a design history](https://x-govuk.github.io/govuk-design-history/get-started/).

## Support

This project is maintained by a small number of volunteers working across government.

For questions about using a design history for your service, bug reports or feedback, [submit a new issue](https://github.com/x-govuk/govuk-design-history-template/issues/new).

## Technical notes

The design history uses the [NHS.UK design system](https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system) and the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) static site generator with the [NHS.UK Eleventy Plugin](https://x-govuk.github.io/nhsuk-eleventy-plugin/).
